There is no rule that u may also get these errors but there are chances......

i fixed the bug mostly you wont face it.

Bugs i found are:-
i have noticed that when the nexmon patch is loaded from then on the wifi just looks like connected but the network
does'nt work. so to get wlan0 working use the command >>>>


    """sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd"""

from then on u can use the internet.

For connecting ssh/vnc :- first of all there will be no problem in connecting with lan,but in 
wlan0 it isn't possible as i said the network needs to be restarted.
So either u can use lan or you can use bluetooth.
I have also included a video of how to connect ssh/vnc from bluetooth. It works perfectly.
If u want to use wlan for ssh/vnc then first connect with bluetooth and then press the command 
"sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd" and then even if it doesn't work try again. For the second time it
definetly works.

*****i suggest using bluetooth for ssh/vnc because when using monitor mode the wlan interface 
will be down*****

For connecting vnc in mobile with bluetooth you should definitly on the internet/network sharing 
which is present at the advanced options of the bluetooth connected device. Only then u can connect to pi with bluetooth
