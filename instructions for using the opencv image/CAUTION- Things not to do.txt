I used nexmon patch which only supports kernel versions 4.9,4.14,4.19. 
When i was making this the latest kernel is 5.4 which doesn't change much.
when you hit ""apt upgrade"" then the kernel gets updated and the nexmon gets crashed. 
So i made a hold on the kernel version not to get updated so when you hit ""apt upgrade"" every thing will be upgraded except your kernel.
when there will be the official support then you can unhold the kernel and make your kernel update.



***Till then don't update your kernel****


In the OS i provided the kernel version is 4.19 (2020)
