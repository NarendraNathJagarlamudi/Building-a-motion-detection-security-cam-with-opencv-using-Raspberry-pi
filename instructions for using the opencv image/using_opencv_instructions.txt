1. I have created an virtual environment called "cv" using wrapperenvs.

2. when u get the error saying "workon not found" use the command "source ~/.profile" 
for updating the user profiles to the bash shell which consists the environment "cv"

3. After making the source profile use the command "workon cv" to enter into the virtual Environment.

Note:- I used the virtual environment because in future if you are working on any other 
project which does not require "open cv" then there will be no dependency issues.
