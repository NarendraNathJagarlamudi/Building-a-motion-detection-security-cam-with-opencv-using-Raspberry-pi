I have already configured manually all the tools like airgeddon, aircrack-ng etc by spending hours.

****There is a good news that the broadcom chipset used in the raspberry pi 3b+ has the support 
of dual functionality. so using monitor mode simultaneously you can connect to wifi for internet and ssh.

****Also this chipset supports 5Ghz band in which this functionality is not even present in Alfa Network Adapter
   which costs around $30. 

1.To activate monitor mode use the command "sudo airmon-ng start wlan0"
2.To turn off monitor mode use the command "sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon"

If any error occurs use the command "sudo airmon-ng check kill"  before the executing step 1.

If get the network-manager back use "sudo service dhcpcd restart"


If the above commands doesn't work in any of the case then use
1.sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
2.sudo airmon-ng check kill
3.sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

Note:- I have included a video of how to configure ssh/vnc using bluetooth so that you can even
       ssh while the network-manager is down
