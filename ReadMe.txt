1) for this project we require opencv and some python libraries (Python 3).
2) I have included an image where opencv is installed with nexmon kernel because it is very
   difficult to install opencv and nexmmon. Nexmon is not required. I just installed it for fun.
3) Use win32disk imager to write the image direclty and easily into the memory card.
4) follow the instructions for image folder if you have any queries.
